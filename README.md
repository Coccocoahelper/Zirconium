This is an Ornithe port of Eliotex's Zirconium mod, with the following optimizations:

- Fast chunk saving (from the original Zirconium mod)
- Smart language reloading (from Mixces' special mod)
- Compact sine lookup table (from Jellysquid's Lithium mod)
- Font batching (from GTNH's Angelica mod, and awruff's port to 1.8.9)
- Hide "Downloading Terrain" screen (from embeddedt's ArchaicFix mod)
- Effect checking by skipping if none are active (from jss2a98aj's BugTorch mod)

Additionally, it has:

- Detail options (from Celeritas Extra)
- Disable text shadows option (from moehreag's mod)

Currently requires Java 21 or higher.
